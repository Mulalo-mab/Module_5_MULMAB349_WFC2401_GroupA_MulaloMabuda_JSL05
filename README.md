## Project: Guardians Playlist Generator

### Resource: Scrimba

### Description:
Guardians Playlist Generator is a JavaScript project developed by Mulalo Mabuda. The project utilizes JavaScript to dynamically generate playlists for each guardian of the galaxy based on their preferred music genre. It employs an array of songs with corresponding titles, artists, and genres to create unique playlists tailored to each guardian's musical taste.

The playlist generation process involves filtering the songs by genre for each guardian, ensuring that the selected songs align with their preferences. To enhance variety and prevent repetition, the project shuffles the available songs and selects a subset of three songs for each playlist.

Furthermore, the project includes functionality to link each song title to a YouTube search, allowing users to easily access and listen to their favorite songs directly from the playlist.

Guardians Playlist Generator serves as an interactive and entertaining tool, offering an enjoyable music discovery experience for fans of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.
